Directions for the program - The program was developed in a way that could be picked up by anyone regardless of tech experience.
Prioritizing simplicity by having a minimalist approach to the amount of buttons or data being displayed. Every action either produces
minor reactions to the visual represented or sends the user to a separate screen so that nothing is ever "too much".

Upon starting the application the user can input their credentials into the text boxes. Once a successful login occurs they are
redirected to the main appointments screen where they will be greeted by a pop-up letting them know if there's an appointment coming up or not.
The page is populated with all the appointments that are in the system and buttons that will lead the user to their desired action.
On the top theres a "Customer" button where it will redirect the user to the customer side of them application where they will see
every customer registered as well as having the option to add, update or delete the customer.
From either customer main screen or appointment main screen there will be a button on the top that is labeled "Reports".
Clicking on that button will redirect the user to the reports page. The two mandatory report tasks will be in the page tab group. The third report of
my choosing will be at the bottom. The report I chose works by generating the total number of customers registered in the system and displaying it.
This can be rather useful for example if the consulting organization wanted to see their growth in terms of customers.
